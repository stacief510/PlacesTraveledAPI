# My Places Traveled
Welcome to my personal European Travel API. This app can be used to log and maintain all the place's I've traveled. 

##Technologies used:
Bootstrap for styling
AJAX to send asynchronous HTTP & Responses requests
Express & Body Parser to provide access to the server
MongoDB and Mongoose for a noSQL Database. 

#Create a Place Schema and a Profile for myself. Profile should be hard coded.
